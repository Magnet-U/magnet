  <p class="titlePost"><strong>toulis's confession</strong><br></p>
  <p>
    I want to catch it. Like they do. Why can’t I catch it?! I try and it slips away. I try and I cannot hold it. I try and my pawn does not grasp like their hand.</p>

  <p> What can I do?</p>

  <p> How can I explain it to these humans, that I don’t want to make the bottle fall to the ground, I want to hold it and drink from it. I tried so hard. It is the same for every object. They are so skilled at using, bending, throwing, shaping, twisting, catching objects, and so much more. One time I saw them masturbating. If I knew how to do it, I could have explained them that I did not need to be operated to my testicles. That I could take care of myself, by myself, without big problems, please leave me this rather enjoyable aspect of life. But I cannot, could not, and have no more working testicles now.</p>

  <p> Yet I keep trying. I guess that they think I am playing. I am not, I am frustrated. The more I try to catch this pink bottle that is now on the ground, the more they laugh and think I am having a hell of a ride. I try again and again, and when I cannot do it anymore, I stop, suddenly, and jump away because I do not want them to see me cry.</p>

  <p> The other night I was trying to make a knot, using the thread they gave me, to “play”, as they think. I wanted, because I see them, every morning, knotting their shoes, and I think that is cool. But I never managed, all my attempts failed, and am still obliged to walk barefoot. I made a mess yesterday with the thread, I think I wasted a lot of thread, at a point I was thinking at hanging myself. But my claws cannot do even that.</p>

  <p> I am sorry that I made a mess. I am sorry that I spilled the glass full of water and fucked up the computer and her thesis inside. I am sorry that his pink bottle fell on the ground so many times. I am not able to let them know this. I feel so sorry. I can only hope they understood it by themselves.

  <p class="titlePost"><strong>SINCE WE SO MUCH SYMPATHIZE</strong><br></p>
  <p> Imagine you wake up one morning, at dawn, 5am. They are bombing your country. You call your friends, they tell you yes they started to fire rockets, you open the newspaper, they say yes they started to fire rockets, you open twitter, facebook, you read yes they started to fire rockets. They is your big neighbor, richer than you, with more weapons, more soldiers than you. You can’t describe what you feel, fear, deep fear for your family, your old parents, your friends, that is a big part of it, with thousands other emotions, melted together to make a unique block of mental and physical pain.</p>

<p>It has been a week of this nightmare, your city is in ruins, destroyed, they are fighting street by street, civilians are attacked as well as other soldiers. The big neighbor that has invaded says that civilians are being used as a human shield, coherently it started to make holes in that shield, to get to the soldier behind -but the hole in social fabric is a painful one. You know people who lost some of their family members, you have seen corpses and weapons. You decided to escape.</p>

<p>But you do not have the city exit visa. Only citizens with the city exit visa can get out of the city, out of its walls, and go towards the country border, to attempt to flee the country. And there are not enough of those city exit visas, the Europeans for some reasons do not want people to leave, not even from the  bombs, they want people to stay and die and become fertilizer for the ground from where they import fruits. But you put so much faith in Europe, and you cannot accept it betrays you like this, and you cannot accept that you will die in the city, and you will do everything to leave and live.</p>

<p>Everything, everywhere around you is being bombed. You lost your parents, they were in the wrong square, at the wrong time, and a rocket hit them. With your parents you almost lost your mind. Everywhere in the city is bombed. Except the north east corner, known for its natural beauty. The agressor agreed not to bomb it, to preserve it, for tourists. And indeed, tourists from all over the world come and go, even now.</p>

<p>It took you one year of prostitution to have enough money to pay for the smuggler. One year of suffering, humiliation, shame, one year that you went into the closet, did not talk to your family, did not want them to know. Then you took all the money you had and you gave it to the smuggler. You were put in the trunk of a taxi, with 2 other people, and stayed there for hours and hours, terrified. When you arrived on the other side of the town, finally out of that living hell of a constantly bombed city, you did not move when the smugglers raped you, like you had never moved every time you were raped in the last year of prostitution.</p>

<p>It has been the fifth time that you tried to cross the border. You are not you anymore. You had a miscarriage last week, and you lost the baby. Maybe you lost it because you were beaten by the police, or because of the cold, or because of the constant fear. You sleep in a shelter that some local volunteers run, but you cannot thank them as you want, because you are not you anymore. Your eyes can only stare blankly.</p>

<p>The European police keeps beating you every time you try to get to Europe, but you do not want to go back to your bombed city. It is your eleventh push back now, every time you try to go, they steal your phone, they beat you, sometimes they rape you. You keep thinking “would have it not been better to die when I tried to exit the city without the city exit visas?”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Text of fantasy inspired by real events, people and places I have seen.
The violence of the border regime of fortress Europe is responsible for the deaths of thousands and the sufferings of millions. Sympathizing with what the people in Ukraine are going through now is only right, and our borders should stay open to welcome them. Sympathizing with them only, when so many other people go around the world go through similar experiences and try to escape, and closing the border on them, is racist.

  <p class="titlePost"><strong>you flush the toilet, the shit comes out of the shower</strong><br></p>
  <p>
  this is one of the things i have seen yesterday in the camp of Eleonas, in Athens.
  Greece has adopted the approach of throwing people who ask for asylum in one of the tens of camps around the country. These camps, even visually, resemble  prisons: they are fenced with barbed wire, and have guarded exits.</p>
<p>
  When you throw people in segregated camps, services are always going to be deficient, or appealing. beside that toilet used by 7 people, I have seen a room in a container completely covered by 4 matresses, to the point that the floor disappears. And a container in Eleonas camp took fire last Friday,  people lost all they had. the list goes on and on. </p>
  <p>
  the strategy adopted by the EU and Greece is to put people far, hide them and contain them with walls, then deprive them of even their basic rights. this is an apartheid system.

  <p class="titlePost"><strong>"Open your fucking border"</strong></p>

  <p>
    It was great to see refugees participating (on fire!) to the protests yesterday! Their struggle is the same struggle of people in Greece in 1973. In 1973, Greeks faced a military dictatorship, didn’t have civil rights. They protested, and the famous motto of the unrest of Polytechneio university was “Bread-Education-Freedom”</p>
    <p>
    Refugees now ask for “Papers-Houses-Freedom”. It is the same struggle as 50 years ago, and it is amazing to see how  people from refugee camps like Malakasa, Thiva, Eleonas came together to say claim their rights. It is amazing to see how they challenged the barriers they face and complemented the dense ideological narrative of the event with very clear examples of what antifascism and anticapitalism looks like: “open your fucking border”, papers, houses. </p>
    <p>
    50 years on, we are still living under the colonels. Shout-out to the refugees (like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parwanaamiriofficial/"> Parwana Amiri</a>) who remind us of that.</p>

  <p class="titlePost"><strong>“Be careful”</strong><br></p>
  <p>I am flying, in this dirty cheap ryanair flight, from Athens to Rome. Next to me an empty seat. I can only guess it belonged to either the man or the woman who were not allowed to board by the police. </p>
  <p>The woman had tears in her eyes, but held them in. The man spoke a few clear words to the police, with no use. When he was checked for his ID, he was asked by a loud, unpolite voice, "what is this?" then the police came. The two policemen took the man out of the line, they took this person on a side and cracked a joke, I did not hear it well but something on the line of "this is not your girlfriend". (They chuckled in the face of this person whom I can only imagine how he was feeling.) Then another approached, their superior?, and the tone changed, he said to the man, "be careful". I know that a person like me, a white person with privileges, would not have been intimidated with a "be careful" by the police. The "be careful" is effective, frightening. It is scary because it leaves a blank, it does not explicit any punishment, it lets imagination and fear fill that gap. The "be careful" can be said in a low tone, no need to shout in front of the tourists. But be careful, and follow us.
    </p>
    <p>
  My ID is a piece of paper, it looks so fake. It even says I am 1.80m, just because I felt like declaring that when in my town they asked me how tall I was. But it was barely checked when I boarded the plane.
  So here I stay, in this dirty cheap Ryanair flight, in my mind still the image of the woman with the tears in her eyes, the chuckling, the be careful, the empty seat, the awareness that I witnessed another piece of this system of borders and inhumanity, the feeling that two people, fugitive from this prison, have been taken by the hair and thrown back into it.

  <p class="titlePost"><strong>...but the best they could find was Europe</strong></p>

<p>The “Moria6” are a group of 6 teenagers accused of setting the fire on Moria. The court condemned two of them to 5 years in March, and on Saturday the remaining four to 10 years. It was a mockery of justice, full of irregularities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliance on a written testimony as the only one that links to the identity of the six, but the man who made it is “untraceable”, so the defence couldn't cross-examine him; </li>
<li>The defendants were not recognized as minors;</li>
<li>The public, journalists, or independent observers were denied entrance to the court, allegedly because of covid measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that court room somebody should have been judged, but not the Moria6: it should have been the Europeans and Greeks that built Moria. Beside depriving people of basic human rights, Moria also caused tens of deaths. And now the people who allegedly set that place on fire are charged of putting at risk human lives. As if the European and institutions and citizens cared about refugee lives.
</p>

<p>As MSF put it: “Let's be very clear, there is no question as to the cause of this fire: it's the years-long orchestration of human suffering and violence produced by European and Greek migration policies that are to blame.”
</p>
<p>The justice system, once again, served to extend the policy of deterrence and containment at the borders of the European Union. It attempts to crush the resistance from the refugees, scapegoating six people who fled their country looking for a better future, but the best they could find was Europe.

<p class="titlePost"><strong>“We don’t understand”</strong><br></p>
<p>We put them in a open-air prison, deprived them of basic services, stole education from their kids. They escaped war and persecution, many have nothing left. But people in the camp are not weak, they have power, and they use it. The resistance they have to put up against us is a display of dignity. There are several groups, just mention three:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoriaWhiteHelmets?_rdc=1&_rdr">Moria White Helmets</a>: these guys collect an incredible amount of trash from thousands of people (because the authorities simply did not care to put up an effective trash collection system). Among their epic battles, they cleaned a river in the old Moria which had become a dump. They also have some skilled electrician in their team, so they set up and maintain a grid for portions in the camp (crazy how people in the camp need to set up their own electricity). I love them when, on their fb page, they speak up against white saviour volunteers who come to the island for 2 weeks in corona time to take a lot of pictures. When that happens, they would normally write “We do not understand”.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam">Moria Corona Awareness Team</a>: Because Moria and now the new camp have never been a place safe from the virus (Moria was built for 3,500 people, it came to host over 20,000, goodbye distances),  people in the camp need to spread awareness and good practices themselves against the virus. Also, they recently started a cooperation with the Hope project to distribute clothes. It works like this: in the camp, people need clothes. Moria Corona Awareness Team tells to the Hope project exactly what is needed, sizes, items, etc, and the next day that gets delivered. Much better when the requests for donations comes from those who will eventually wear them.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/now_you_see_me_moria/">now_you_see_me_moria</a>: is a courageous person from Afghanistan who, since the fire destroyed Moria, denounces the violation of human rights inside the camp. And that means taking upon himself a risk, as taking pictures inside the camp is illegal and the police comes after you when you do. Just to stress this: it is illegal to document the lack of basic services inside the camp, to take pictures, even from the people who live in there.
</p>
<p>
The point is that people in the camp are not simply passive recipients of our pity, they have strength and continuously show it. They only need us to fight on their side the oppressive system that the EU set up against them.

<p class="titlePost"><strong>5 years of mercenary</strong></p>

<p>Five years ago, on 18 March 2016, the European Union decided to have Turkey as its mercenary to process asylum requests. It works like this: the EU does not want black and brown refugees, so it pays Turkey to take them. The agreement was premised on the assumption that Turkey is a safe country where to ask for asylum and on the will to reduce the number of people lodging their claim to international protection in the European Union. The mercenary is expensive: the EU paid €6 billion to Turkey to retain and manage asylum seekers. It also introduced a “fast-track” border procedure in the asylum process, to return to Turkey those of Syrian nationality who had managed to escape border controls and land on the EU.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the agreement transformed what had been, until then, a refugee crisis into a legal crisis. It introduced the regime of geographical restriction, meaning that people who had managed to land in Greece and ask for asylum, were blocked on the islands. Greek islands started to be open-air prisons, but the official literature keeps preferring the name “hotspots”. Regardless of considerations relating to the diminishment of the rights of asylum seekers, including the right of movement, hotspot reception centers have never provided adequate standards of living for people living there. This is a gross understatement, because it is difficult to describe in a few lines a system where people try to commit suicide, for example. Also, the backlog in the asylum process was huge: asylum seekers were left on the islands for years before the completion of their asylum process.
</p>
<p>
When the Moria camp on Lesvos was set on fire as a form of resistance on behalf of some asylum seekers and refugees living there, expectations were high that a new, more humane asylum and reception process might be put in place. The ensuing Migration and Asylum Pact proposed by the European Commission however, brings the logic of the EU-Turkey statement even farther, supporting the creation of closed reception centers. They want to open the first one on Lesvos by September this year. The temporary facility where people are blocked now is -shameful, scandalous, undignified… fill the blank yourself.  It witnesses that EU has not changed its mind, that “No more Morias” by the authorities is just another lie, and that if we want to change this system of detention and oppression, we need to do it ourselves.
