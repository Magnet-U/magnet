  <p class="titlePost">GOODBYE GOOGLE<br></p>


<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>

Let’s skip the introduction on why it is important to get rid of Google services. Let’s dig straight into the how-to. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Objective</strong>
We want to save our contacts on the contact book of our phone, but we also want to synchronize those contacts on a cloud. That is very useful because, if we loose our phone, we can find the contacts back, and secondly because we can access contacts through many devices. And we want to do this without Google services. At the moment, our contacts are synchronized through Google Contacts. Let’s get rid of this spyware. </p>

<p>

<strong>First step: Save your contacts. </strong>
You should be able to do this through your mobile phone contacts application (export to .cvc file).

Your contacts are probably saved on Google Contacts, so you can also open your email, click on the sandwich menu top right, check the “export” option.
<br><br>
The point is, be very sure that you exported your contacts and stored them somewhere safe.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Second step: Order the contacts </strong>
Your contacts should be saved in a single neat .cvc file. So, if you have more than one file (for example, downloading multiple contact sheets from multiple google accounts), you should merge them and have a single neat .cvc file.
	<br><br>
How? On Ubuntu, I downloaded “vCard studio”, opened and merged several sheets and ended up with one. I also downloaded “Evolution”, then opened that same sheet and saved it as it is (somehow the vCard studio format wasn’t good for the steps afterwards). 
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>
Third step: Download the good apps </strong>
On F-droid (it is an open source app store, if you do not have it download it) download: 
<li>
DAVx → this is a software which enables synchronization from your phone to your server (cloud)</li>
<li>Simple Contacts Pro SE (by Stephan Ritscher, it is a fork of simple contacts app developed by Tibor Kaputa) → this app supports synchronization, it will be your contact book.</li></p>
<p>
<strong>
Fourth step: Open your framagenda account </strong>
framagenda.org offers you an account of 15MB for free. This is more than enough to synchronize your entire contact book:) <br> <br>

Once you opened your account, you will have your cloud. </p>
<p>
<strong>Fifth step: connect everything </strong>
Go on DAVx app. Check the “login with URL and user name”. In “base url”, start typing framagenda and select the option that pops up. Your username and password are those that you used to open your framagenda.org account (your username should be your email).
<br> <br>
Once it connects, make sure the app is connecting your contacts (swipe “Contacts” so that it toggles orange).
<br> <br>
You can test this. If you go on framagenda.org, on the menu dedicated to contacts, try creating a test contact. Then, open your phone, and check the contacts app we downloaded. You should see it there. It should also work the other way around (but on the phone app, make sure you save the contacts not on google drive, but on framagenda. This is the last field on the contact).
<br> </p>
<p><strong>
Sixth step: the point of no return (not true but I wanted something sounding drastic)</strong>
Delete all your contacts and disable the normal contact book app. They might interfere and we need a blank slate to start the synchronization process. Your new contact book app will be the one downloaded (simple contacts pro se). 
Even if you delete your contacts, you have them backed up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Seventh step: upload your contacts on framagenda </strong>
You will see, on your account on framagenda.org, that there is a “Contacts” tab. Check the sandwich menu, then “Contacts settings”, and “import contacts”. There, you will be able to import the neat .cvs file that you prepared. 
<br><br>
<i>Tricks:</i> 
<li>on framagenda.org, you might want to delete all of your contacts, and do the import again. You have to go on the address books again, but if you only have one address book, you cannot delete it. You need to first create another address book (give it any name then click on the arrow), then you can delete the first contact book.</li>
<li>on simple contacts pro se app, on your phone, when you create a new contact, you need to make sure to save it in a way that it connects to the framagenda server, not to a google account. You can choose this by sliding to the last field.</li> </p>

<p>
 
<strong>Eight step: Google good bye </strong>
Go on google drive, go to the google contact app, check all your contacts, delete them. 
<br> <br>
Take a step back. Breath deeply. You made it.</p>


<p>
<strong>Extra:</strong> once you did all of this, you are really very close to synchronize other very useful services, for which you might rely on google. Those are notes, calendar, tasks. Let’s see them in the next guide. 
</p>

<p><strong>
Extra 2:</strong>
Generally if you don’t pay you are the product. This is an exception, you are not going to pay anything, and all the services that we downloaded is open source, privacy oriented software. Check the website framasoft.org on this (framagenda is one of their services). It does not mean the service is cost-free, it just means some other activist for a free internet is donating.<p>
  </p>
  <p><font color="hotpink"><strong>
  How to replace other services</strong></font color>
</p>
<p><strong>
Calendar </strong>
<li>Download the calendar app “Etar” on F-Droid </li>
<li>Open the app, go to settings, and make sure the app is synchronizing on the framagenda account email (not on the google services)</li>
<li>(Double check that DAVx is also synchronizing on the Caldav menu)</li>

</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>
<li>Download on F-Droid the “Nextcloud” app, on server add framagenda.org, then your id (email) and password </li>
<li>Download the “Nextcloud Notes” app from F-Droid.</li>
<li>Once you synchronize, you should find your notes on framagenda.org </li>

</p><p><strong>
Task </strong> 
<li>Download “Open Tasks” on F-Droid </li>
<li>There is a way to synch it, I couldn’t:) just save your tasks in “local”, that’s good enough</li>

  <p class="titlePost"> diary from the Med. day 8</p>
  <p>
    it starts while overhearing a position of a boat by a tunisian fisherman [on radio channel 16, used to send distress alarms. Radio channels are open]. He was speaking italian and mixing it with french. we start heading there, we are only 14 miles away, while the geo barens is over 100 miles away, they are in the south. shortly afterwards we have confirmation about the case by sea bird [patrolling plane supporting the civil fleet], and sea bird also tells that there is a second case, next to the first one. sea bird voice was tense when communicating (even if they follow the radio etiquette perfectly): two cases are a lot to handle. the voice describes two almost identical situations: about 40 people per boat, engine not working, water level very high, very high waves, high risk of capsizing. you could see the human behind the technical communication, the message was, lives at risk, and a huge knot on the throat. emotionally the most difficult moment was when seabird sent a mayday relay on 16/9, a little after, I was steering the boat and I felt the moment.
    </p>  <p>
  for us, we had two cases to handle, almost identical, so it comes that question. it was a natural choice to go to the closest one first, natural yes but not a choice to take without a stone in our heart. you know that a few hours later or earlier can make the difference. we go towards the case that was closest, the one spotted by sea bird.
    </p>  <p>
  only one hour away. we drive there to the speed the engine allows, engine was a bit fucked up because the fan broke, so we leave the door of the engine room open at the cost of the heat in the aft cabin and bathroom. to sea bird we said we would be there at 4.
    </p>  <p>
  we see them from a distance. the water level is incredibly low. a steel boat completely overcrowded. waves were 1.5 to 2 meters high. the boat was at risk of capsizing. we talk to them from the nadir first, i talk to them with the megaphone, for first intro, assessment, people cooperation. i find the person that helped me to repeat for everybody. established the connection within the boat, there is a deputy me from the inside and he will help.
    </p>  <p>
  because of the waves we cannot take them boat to boat, we need to do the evacuation with the rhib. i am the rhib communicator, with A* the doctor and G* the driver. helmets on, we are ready to go. rhib gets in the water, then G*, then i. A* takes some extra seconds, she needs to find the intercom. then she comes, we go towards their boat with two meters high waves. we assess and explain them that first we will distribute lifejackets for everybody. we do that in two or three rounds, there was one child -which means, one child lifejacket. during the lifejacket distribution, there was this moment where i stopped the process and told the rhib driver to go backwards, putting a distance between us and them. people had started to move too much, asking for a lifejacket at the same time, some was trying to grab one. we pulled back and there was silence, all at once, incredible strength of the submarine effect. i made it clear we cannot proceed this way, i will pass the lifejackets to the person with the white t-shirt at the stern, and in turn lifejackets will move all the way upward, to the bow, until each has one. and i ask for silence. when we come close and start the distribution again, there is an unreal silence.
    </p>  <p>
  after, the transhipment. there is 11 women and a child, first we take them, by rounds of two and three. rhib work is physically destroying, you pull the people, attach the rope, push the rhib, we almost got the engine of the rhib stuck under the nadir once. then we do the men. by rounds of three, last round of five. people cooperation works, with also the help of the person inside.
    </p>  <p>
  it is crazy people in survival mode, some of them just want to survive and skip the line. some tried to get in the rhib almost by diving in, several just kept asking to go first, to come. and after they enter the rhib you see them and they recover from this madness and fear, and you would like to shake them and say what the fuck, then you realize you cannot blame them anything, anything at all.
    </p>  <p>
  in the rhib we get snippets of conversation, it was 4 days they were in the water, without food, said one woman. when we took her she started to cry out of relief.
    </p>  <p>
  we get them all on board, with the rhib, waves entering in the rhib so much that at the end we almost did not manage to pull it up because of the weight. while it was waving in the air, penched on one side, the automatic winch broke and we risked breaking the motor. we pull water out of the rhib with buckets, it worked in the end. 2 m waves.
    </p>  <p>
  the rhib is not even secured that we are already going towards the second case. it takes about two hours. those who can rest rest, J* is very careful to oblige us to rest so that we can give our whole during the action. i stay on the floor then dry up and rest on the sofa. i put back my clothes that had dried up a bit and am back, half an hour before contact. night about to fall. malta had even sent an helicopter. sea bird was flying in circles, signaling us the position - it was crazy. they talk to us and tell us, when we had made contact, that they were relieved, and were sending cheers to the crew, before they had to fly away because they had no more fuel.
    </p>  <p>
  slightly better weather allows us to try to go for the boat to boat transhipment, even if N* and i would have preferred the rhib. i make again contact, people cooperation, and explain what we would need to do. two people from their boat hold ropes. here the risky thing is that they lose their fingers or that the boat capsizes, because of the rolling of their boat against ours. again a trick is to find the person who helps inside. i found him and the guy stayed there the whole time making sure none had their fingers stuck under the boat, and came out of there almost last.
    </p>  <p>
  situation is difficult because it is dark and weather not good. but we managed. a couple of difficult times, cause we did not even have a ladder, people had to use a tire. i was closing the exit, deciding the person next, and making people cooperation. one young lady seemed almost blocked by fear, then i paused, made eye contact with her, hands together in the namaste, saying it will work out. and it worked, i saw in her eyes courage coming back. we made several pauses during the process.
    </p>  <p>
  for both cases the people that we rescued were amazingly calm relative to the situation. the approach i had with them was, i realised i cannot leave door open to discussion. even at a point i realised some started to be disappointed when i said we will rescue them to italy, so i could not leave the door open to something like no i want to go to germany. i need to be direct as for what they have to do, but in a humane and dignified way, i was looking for their cooperation, explaining why, explaining everything, finding partners within, and calling them les gars or friends or brothers, or mama or papa.  </p>
    <p>
  then it comes the last phase, trashipment to the charlie papa [the italian coastguard]. it is the same fucked up guy who did it the other time, he screams against everybody,  insults come, no you cannot do this job, and similar shit. he was making everybody go so fast that something very grave happened, one of the person almost fell between the two boats, J* managed to hold him. because they put so much stress and crisis into this. now i am too tired to write more, but we were and are very angry.  </p>

  <p>
  *notes: <br>
  - people cooperation is normally called crowd control or crowd management, that means talking to the people to make sure we have their collaboration during the rescue and try to keep the stability of the boat. I don't like neither the concepts of crowd nor the one of control, so i replaced it.<br>
  - the above might seem pretty self-centered. it is, cause it is a diary, I will not expand but the crew was amazing and the people rescued even more.

<p>The violence of the border regime of fortress Europe is responsible for the deaths of thousands and the sufferings of millions. Sympathizing with what the people in Ukraine are going through now is only right, and our borders should stay open to welcome them. Sympathizing with them only, when so many other people go around the world go through similar experiences and try to escape, and closing the border on them, is racist.

  <p class="titlePost">you flush the toilet, the shit comes out of the shower <br></p>
  <p>
  this is one of the things i have seen yesterday in the camp of Eleonas, in Athens.
  Greece has adopted the approach of throwing people who ask for asylum in one of the tens of camps around the country. These camps, even visually, resemble  prisons: they are fenced with barbed wire, and have guarded exits.</p>
<p>
  When you throw people in segregated camps, services are always going to be deficient, or appealing. beside that toilet used by 7 people, I have seen a room in a container completely covered by 4 matresses, to the point that the floor disappears. And a container in Eleonas camp took fire last Friday,  people lost all they had. the list goes on and on. </p>
  <p>
  the strategy adopted by the EU and Greece is to put people far, hide them and contain them with walls, then deprive them of even their basic rights. this is an apartheid system.

  <p class="titlePost">"Open your fucking border"</p>

  <p>
    It was great to see refugees participating (on fire!) to the protests yesterday! Their struggle is the same struggle of people in Greece in 1973. In 1973, Greeks faced a military dictatorship, didn’t have civil rights. They protested, and the famous motto of the unrest of Polytechneio university was “Bread-Education-Freedom”</p>
    <p>
    Refugees now ask for “Papers-Houses-Freedom”. It is the same struggle as 50 years ago, and it is amazing to see how  people from refugee camps like Malakasa, Thiva, Eleonas came together to say claim their rights. It is amazing to see how they challenged the barriers they face and complemented the dense ideological narrative of the event with very clear examples of what antifascism and anticapitalism looks like: “open your fucking border”, papers, houses. </p>
    <p>
    50 years on, we are still living under the colonels. Shout-out to the refugees (like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parwanaamiriofficial/"> Parwana Amiri</a>) who remind us of that.</p>

  <p class="titlePost">“Be careful”<br></p>
  <p>I am flying, in this dirty cheap ryanair flight, from Athens to Rome. Next to me an empty seat. I can only guess it belonged to either the man or the woman who were not allowed to board by the police. </p>
  <p>The woman had tears in her eyes, but held them in. The man spoke a few clear words to the police, with no use. When he was checked for his ID, he was asked by a loud, unpolite voice, "what is this?" then the police came. The two policemen took the man out of the line, they took this person on a side and cracked a joke, I did not hear it well but something on the line of "this is not your girlfriend". (They chuckled in the face of this person whom I can only imagine how he was feeling.) Then another approached, their superior?, and the tone changed, he said to the man, "be careful". I know that a person like me, a white person with privileges, would not have been intimidated with a "be careful" by the police. The "be careful" is effective, frightening. It is scary because it leaves a blank, it does not explicit any punishment, it lets imagination and fear fill that gap. The "be careful" can be said in a low tone, no need to shout in front of the tourists. But be careful, and follow us.
    </p>
    <p>
  My ID is a piece of paper, it looks so fake. It even says I am 1.80m, just because I felt like declaring that when in my town they asked me how tall I was. But it was barely checked when I boarded the plane.
  So here I stay, in this dirty cheap Ryanair flight, in my mind still the image of the woman with the tears in her eyes, the chuckling, the be careful, the empty seat, the awareness that I witnessed another piece of this system of borders and inhumanity, the feeling that two people, fugitive from this prison, have been taken by the hair and thrown back into it.

<p>The “Moria6” are a group of 6 teenagers accused of setting the fire on Moria. The court condemned two of them to 5 years in March, and on Saturday the remaining four to 10 years. It was a mockery of justice, full of irregularities, including:</p>

<li>Reliance on a written testimony as the only one that links to the identity of the six, but the man who made it is “untraceable”, so the defence couldn't cross-examine him; </li>
<li>The defendants were not recognized as minors;</li>
<li>The public, journalists, or independent observers were denied entrance to the court, allegedly because of covid measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In that court room somebody should have been judged, but not the Moria6: it should have been the Europeans and Greeks that built Moria. Beside depriving people of basic human rights, Moria also caused tens of deaths. And now the people who allegedly set that place on fire are charged of putting at risk human lives. As if the European and institutions and citizens cared about refugee lives.
</p>

<p>As MSF put it: “Let's be very clear, there is no question as to the cause of this fire: it's the years-long orchestration of human suffering and violence produced by European and Greek migration policies that are to blame.”
</p>
<p>The justice system, once again, served to extend the policy of deterrence and containment at the borders of the European Union. It attempts to crush the resistance from the refugees, scapegoating six people who fled their country looking for a better future, but the best they could find was Europe.

<p class="titlePost">“We don’t understand”<br></p>
<p>We put them in a open-air prison, deprived them of basic services, stole education from their kids. They escaped war and persecution, many have nothing left. But people in the camp are not weak, they have power, and they use it. The resistance they have to put up against us is a display of dignity. There are several groups, just mention three:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoriaWhiteHelmets?_rdc=1&_rdr">Moria White Helmets</a>: these guys collect an incredible amount of trash from thousands of people (because the authorities simply did not care to put up an effective trash collection system). Among their epic battles, they cleaned a river in the old Moria which had become a dump. They also have some skilled electrician in their team, so they set up and maintain a grid for portions in the camp (crazy how people in the camp need to set up their own electricity). I love them when, on their fb page, they speak up against white saviour volunteers who come to the island for 2 weeks in corona time to take a lot of pictures. When that happens, they would normally write “We do not understand”.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoriaCoronaAwarenessTeam">Moria Corona Awareness Team</a>: Because Moria and now the new camp have never been a place safe from the virus (Moria was built for 3,500 people, it came to host over 20,000, goodbye distances),  people in the camp need to spread awareness and good practices themselves against the virus. Also, they recently started a cooperation with the Hope project to distribute clothes. It works like this: in the camp, people need clothes. Moria Corona Awareness Team tells to the Hope project exactly what is needed, sizes, items, etc, and the next day that gets delivered. Much better when the requests for donations comes from those who will eventually wear them.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/now_you_see_me_moria/">now_you_see_me_moria</a>: is a courageous person from Afghanistan who, since the fire destroyed Moria, denounces the violation of human rights inside the camp. And that means taking upon himself a risk, as taking pictures inside the camp is illegal and the police comes after you when you do. Just to stress this: it is illegal to document the lack of basic services inside the camp, to take pictures, even from the people who live in there.
</p>
<p>
The point is that people in the camp are not simply passive recipients of our pity, they have strength and continuously show it. They only need us to fight on their side the oppressive system that the EU set up against them.

<p class="titlePost">5 years of mercenary</p>

<p>Five years ago, on 18 March 2016, the European Union decided to have Turkey as its mercenary to process asylum requests. It works like this: the EU does not want black and brown refugees, so it pays Turkey to take them. The agreement was premised on the assumption that Turkey is a safe country where to ask for asylum and on the will to reduce the number of people lodging their claim to international protection in the European Union. The mercenary is expensive: the EU paid €6 billion to Turkey to retain and manage asylum seekers. It also introduced a “fast-track” border procedure in the asylum process, to return to Turkey those of Syrian nationality who had managed to escape border controls and land on the EU.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the agreement transformed what had been, until then, a refugee crisis into a legal crisis. It introduced the regime of geographical restriction, meaning that people who had managed to land in Greece and ask for asylum, were blocked on the islands. Greek islands started to be open-air prisons, but the official literature keeps preferring the name “hotspots”. Regardless of considerations relating to the diminishment of the rights of asylum seekers, including the right of movement, hotspot reception centers have never provided adequate standards of living for people living there. This is a gross understatement, because it is difficult to describe in a few lines a system where people try to commit suicide, for example. Also, the backlog in the asylum process was huge: asylum seekers were left on the islands for years before the completion of their asylum process.
</p>
<p>
When the Moria camp on Lesvos was set on fire as a form of resistance on behalf of some asylum seekers and refugees living there, expectations were high that a new, more humane asylum and reception process might be put in place. The ensuing Migration and Asylum Pact proposed by the European Commission however, brings the logic of the EU-Turkey statement even farther, supporting the creation of closed reception centers. They want to open the first one on Lesvos by September this year. The temporary facility where people are blocked now is -shameful, scandalous, undignified… fill the blank yourself.  It witnesses that EU has not changed its mind, that “No more Morias” by the authorities is just another lie, and that if we want to change this system of detention and oppression, we need to do it ourselves.
