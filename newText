quando le sole cose attorno a te sono quelle che non puoi fare. quando il briciolo di coscienza che ti rimane è sufficiente appena a farti rendere conto che sei prigioniera, che sei controllata. e a farti capire che non capisci, che ti mancano pezzi, le fondamenta della tua vita. così strisci la tua esistenza da un giorno all'altro, aspettando di morire, ma la cassa esterna è forte, dura, si è svuotata ma si regge su se stessa come una stella marina, di quelle essicate, bianche. morta ma integra. la tua volontà si è ridotta a volertene andare, la tua coscienza a sapere che hanno deciso di rinchiuderti.
in realtà avrebbe un qualche senso, in altre condizioni. se non fossi rinchiusa in una prigione a pagamento, avrebbe molto più senso. potresti vivere nelle case dei figlie. li saresti a casa tua, o almeno più tua che la prigione. vero, ti ricorderesti, nella lucidità che ti rimane, che il suocero non ti ha mai dato il benvenuto, mai ti ha invitato a cena, spesso ha messo il broncio le volte che rimanevi, non ti dava vino, o una dose ridicola. ma avrebbe un senso, il senso dello stare bene. perchè tu ancora puoi stare bene, anche se non ti ricordi chi sei, ma a sprazzi puoi, e finchè puoi ha senso rimanere in vita. ma se la lucidità che ti resta la consumi nel desiderare di evadere, nell'amarezza che non puoi, non ha senso. abbiamo creato una società che usa e consuma, le cose come le persone. e quando sei consumata, ti butta. sei in compagnia, ti dicono -per lavarsi la coscienza?. è vero, in compagnia di altri vecchini disabilitati, prigioniere uguali a te. non è una compagnia abilitante. ti tengono in vita, pensavo, ma perchè? non è un valore aggiunto, il cumulo degli anni. a un certo punto bisogna andarsene, e i servizi che ti strappano da una morte consolante non sono servizi, diventano un'illogica ostinazione, non tua, delle altre, a mantenere prigioniera un'anima che non c'è più da tempo.

quando sei entrata in ascensore, già ti eri forse dimenticata che sono venuto a trovarti. alemno siamo stati bene assieme, quell'ora. hai fatto anche una cosa molto bella. è entrata in ascensore con te un'altra signora, messa peggio di te, su una sedia a rotelle. si lamentava, non a parole, a versi, che dicono di più a volte. ti sei chinata e le hai detto, "siamo qui, siamo qui".

Instead, in the last few weeks, I have geared up and progressively involved myself in things. that makes me feel happy, the being part of something, the being part of a movement, of activity, the getting to know people, talking and exchanging ideas, dancing, listening to music together, the activism makes me feel happy. participating in demos, shouting in the streets, protesting, opposing police violence, being on a cycle of adrenaline that makes me able to be ready, forward, operative.

some people are like trees. they take time, fertile soil, advance planning, good conditions, clear destinations and trajectories. an investment that will return, for sure it will return because it is insured. I am like a mushroom spora. I can sprig out wherever and whenever, without previous commitments, in the absence of perspective, without warning, also in hostile environments.  and then if it dies in three days, it does not matter, it is more important that it branched out.

navigating blindfold without reference, in a lost sea, like martin eden, similarly to him who tried to get the codes, the keys, to the inaccessible bourgeois society, but at a higher level, scoping trying to understand which life to live. at home i read all the books that were at home. and that is not something to be plauded, it is a testament to my complete sense of being lost, i did not know what i liked, i was trying to find out. i was also trying to finish everything out of a alfa male controlling and prone to challenges spirit that society instilled me. and when i grew older and went to the library, the feltrinelli,  i tried to do the same. i just tried to read every book of the library. to my dismay, i understood that i could not have done it, out of the sheer number of books. but i thought it and i tried, because i did not know what to look for, i was scoping blidly for everything. and further and further i am starting to zoom into what i like. like the social movement that i am discovering now. i had to be lost, in an unaccessible city, without references. where are the people like me? how do i find them? it is like contacting aliens. they probably exist, but you have no idea how to contact them. and then by attempts and lost evenings and days wasted, you build the seeds of something that rolls over and over and becomes something bigger, and you dont have the full picture, but you start to understand what direction you want to take.

so unfair it's life with us. we like people, we love people, we love living beings, we look and reach out for warmth, the warmth of the body, of the flesh, of the kynetic energies of living beings. but we are always rejected. we are despised, repulsed, and murdered. nothing is more dispensable than the life of a small fly. we do not weight anything, make almost no noise compared to cars, and are exceptionally small. we are a fragment of a fraction of a portion of a human body. and yet we are called a nuisance, annoying, a pest. and they kill us. we love our killers. but we do our best thwarting their murderous efforts, actually one third our best is enough, and mostly they do not manage to catch us, and even if we love them, we have a sadic appreciation of the theater of their relentless contorsions to crush us, sadic not because we enjoy their delusional show, but because we value staying alive in this life that we live, our only meaningful bond is the BDSM relation with those who try to kill us, but without safe words because we do not speak the same language. We are flies, we are always high on acid, to be sadic enough to want to live this life.

On monogamy. A story.

Monogamy is functional to preserving the inner social circle. It came to being when humans started to feel the bites of jealousy, that sentiment originated in the feral world as territoriality, then watered down as appropriate for a creature without teeth nor claws. Thus monogamy won the battle against polygamy, in an epic fight which opposed the bestial instincts of jealousy to the anarchic aspiration to freedom. Both indeed reside, as wagering neighbors, in the soul of humans, since the beginning of times. 

At the beginnings of times humans, almost primates back then, used to freely mate with their similar on a random encounter. Sex and its needs was neither romanticized, nor devilized, but simply performed with the ease we now reserve to a handshake. That was the time of polygamy. Humans were simple, they could not harbor in their minds deceit or treachery or double games. They were honestly engaged with the game of survival, and killed when they had to, outplayed their enemies when they could not leverage force, but their souls remained pure. They started to succeed as a species. Their number multiplied and, first in the history of the animal kingdom, they created more value than they could consume: they had invented wealth.

However, wealth made a few humans, richer than the others, in the conditions of not having to work, hunt or labor to survive, they had already more than enough and could stay unemployed. At the time, unemployment was an unheard of luxury. They had time to waste. They did not know what to do with that time, and they became more cultivated, more sophisticated, but also more shallow, the same shallowness and sophistication that stretches sacred values to hollow sentiments. From leisure, they invented laziness, from friendship, they created intrigues, out of love they made passion. And out of polygamy, they grew jealous. While before primates had never heard of jealousy, these wealthier humans started to lucubrate on the impurity connected from having different prongs go through the same cavity, not, however, out of understandable hygienic concerns, but rather on the more philosophic ground of possession. It cannot be fully mine, if it is used by somebody else, ran the new argument, the enormity of which would have Friedman bow in veneration, if we could proportionally translate that articulation in modern economic terms.

Monogamy was just rearing its head and with it, internal strives. In the groups of our ancestors, what was before the common practice of free sex became more and more countered by the adversarial posturing of these most prominent members of the society, who had elaborated the new thinking. Indeed, at the beginning monogamy was not articulated as an argument per se, it was rather the natural consequence of male primates exerting a new type of control over female primates: they would have sex with them, and not allow others to have sex with them. Nobody thought, of course, about asking what the females had to say with respect to this pretense to sexual uniqueness, which rendered them mono-use gloves, back then as much as now, decisions are taken by males. Not all males agreed to the new trend of events either, some were keenly all too aware that the new situation was fueled by such a thinking and feeling, that had nothing of natural but rather smelled of Jack Daniels leftover the morning after. Those people, let’s call them the anarchists, did not have and did not want to feel the temptation of uniquely possessing a female, for quite a few reasons, and also because they understood that, out of coherence, they would have to deprive themselves of many occasions to have fun too.

A brief fight interjected, the possessive rich and their followers, attracted by the monies of their patrons, waged war to the anarchists, who were simply the majority of humans, that had lived in a certain way until then, and did not see a reason to change. The possessives, even if less numerous, were better fed and armed, won over the anarchists, and imposed the new norm: nobody could have sex again to a female that a possessive had fecundated. Because that way of being became the normative paradigm of society, by force imposed on the anarchists as well, and because by some strange physical law, there is roughly one male per female, human society found themselves monogamist. Each was holding on their one female partner, in the fear that, if fecundated by somebody else, the one chance to spread one’s semen, and with it to alleviate the onerous physiological and mental burden everybody creates, would be lost.

Monogamy was a strategy, it soon became a value. Among the possessives, an even more aggressive category emerged, one that would complete the subversion of the previous anarchic order to enhance their private interest. That, of course, was the category of the priests. The priests noticed that, to root their control over society at the time, they had to motivate and ennoble monogamy. Indeed, the abandonment of the previous conditions of sexual freedom for the jealousy-fueled uniqueness of sexual partners was already having a few drawbacks, and some, even among the possessives, were lingering in some ideas of coming back to the previous order. It was in particular those who had been partnered to a mate that, for a reason or the other, did not seem as appealing on the first fuck than on the thousandth, when fantasy and creativity had exhausted all possible and impossible positions, including those on the trees. The priests had a thunderbolt idea: to defend monogamy that was the consequence of possessiveness, they invented marriage. Marriage, or the sacralization of monogamy, vested the practice, that until then had had more connotations of domestic abuse than others, with the authority and idealism of once-in-a-lifetime love. Marriage, as an institution, exalted the social practice of monogamy, and posited the last nail in the coffin of anarchy.

Handily enough for the priests, only them, who invented the ritual of marriage and its sacred gadgets, as a belt for the finger, whose meaning nobody understood at the beginning, because fingers usually do not wear pants, only them as we say could perform the ritual. Once they detained the keys to sexual encounters and reproduction, the priests became the ultimate masters of society, even over the other laic possessives their peers that they could blackmail at their convenience: I will not let you marry, or your daughter, and your lifeblood will extinguish. In a last move that, like a cherry on the cake, shows the contours of the priests ability to seize, keep, and expand power across ages, they set the ultimate rule: they would not be subjugated to the bonds of marriage themselves. By playing this check mate rule to the rest of society, priests became the ultimate arbiters of its social, political and spiritual development: nobody could blackmail the priests with the threat that marriage would not be performed. Nobody could submit the priests to the humiliating experience of being bonded, mind and body, to a mate not always wanted, for life. And most importantly, the priests, without the obligation of marriage, were also excluded by that of monogamy, a profligacy soon extended to age and gender.

To these days, a few, sparse and unconnected anarchists remain, who never accepted the new order, but are too uncoordinated and unorganized to bring back the old one.
