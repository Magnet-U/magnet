isn't it crazy that we live meters away from people we don't know at all? there are infrastructural and cultural barriers that means that the neighbor in front, we never speak to.



you flush the toilet, the shit comes out of the shower:
this is one of the things i have seen yesterday in the camp of Eleonas, in Athens.
Greece has adopted the approach of throwing people who ask for asylum in one of the tens of camps around the country. These camps, even visually, resemble  prisons: they are fenced with barbed wire, and have guarded exits.
When you throw people in segregated camps, services are always going to be deficient, or appealing. beside that toilet used by 7 people, I have seen a room in a container completely covered by 4 matresses, to the point that the floor disappears. And a container in Eleonas camp took fire last Friday,  eople lost all they had. the list goes on and on.
the strategy adopted by the EU and Greece is to put people far, hide them and contain them with walls, then deprive them of even their basic rights. this is an apartheid system.
