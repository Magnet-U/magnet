    listening to cat stevens, "take your time, think a lot, find a girl, settle down. look at me, i am old but i am happy". what he puts into music, is the musical backdrop that buzzes into the minds of people since thousands of years. we think at our lives thinking at their ends. we think at the way we would like to die, and we work towards it. sometimes we even rush and hope to approach fast those last miles. more or less, the common imaginary is to spend ourselves sitting on a bench under a porch, with the wife preparing coffee and children and grandchildren coming from time to time, or all the time, to pay tribute. we came to a point that the wife wishes the same. bob marley thanks cat stevens for his contribution and sends this rat race to fuck off.  </p>
    <p>
  the rat race is when we wake up in life, and our childhood is spoiled by having to rush through courses, the school, which has to prepare you for the remaining of the race. that is how the rat inside us begins, bit by bit the rat eats up alive the child inside seen by that colonialist morbid sick sad human beeing called pascoli. then we work, and nothing is ever enough. it is not enough to gain money, you need to make the cv. when you are making the cv, you need to make a better cv. and while we are sacrifizing our lives for money, because we need money to live, we follow that pattern which society seeded, embedded in us since our first days: work, gain, save, settle, marry, reproduce, die. have some fun on the side, cause you need not to think at pattern, the pill is too bitter to swallow. we have created some nice places, shopping malls, discos, stupid movies, and then if you have a bigger budget, houses and cars, all this we have created to help you not think. we have created relations, because gossiping is a never ending tale, and when you finished telling it you can tell it again. beatifully in its aestetics, you are your own fata morgana, tricking yourselves in a mirage that,  the closest you get, the farthest it goes. some find a respise in higher education, but don't worry, university is beautiful but poor, and we parents will soon (have they already?) blackmail the economic burden that you are, and you will soon find yourself hoping to end that ephemeral freedom with the freedom of economic bonds.
  <p>
  because the mirage needs money, so go back in the loop, lower you head like the donkey on the yoke, cause this is what we are, and if you pull that yoke hard enough, you might reach the end of the field. we timed it so that, by the time you finished, it is night. and you see, we have all this beautiful things to offer, and the night is coming, so go fast, you are competing. the donkey next to you is trying to snap your position, the one ahead is already earning more than you. run, lower your head lower and pull harder. along the way we have established men dressed up in white, they will encourage you nice words and don't worry, if you tumble and die, they will whisper you in your ear that you have been forgiven for the times you did not pull hard enough, for when you raised your head, for when you stopped moving for a moment because a revolutionary thought passed through you and you were contemplating it in awe, before masking it how they taught you to mask it. those are nice soft spoken men, we only entrust this important task to the best of us.
<p>  you are tuna eating tuna cans. in this delusion, life, the only thing worth living, escapes.

    they call us jellyfish, because humans are stupid. they take the closest thing they know, fish, they take the second closest thing they know, jam, and they combine them to use them as a new descriptive mark. they call it creativity, which is a self-celebratory way to hide their own dumbness.</p>  <p>
our name is medusas. we are among the oldest creature in the world, we saw the time from the time of the dinausars, we stayed in the water since the beginning of the times. we were telling our brothers and sisters not to go out of the water, but a few of them did not listen. like lucifer, they were drowned in their own ubris, wanted to have more, emerged from the sea and slowly and slowly, tentacles became limbs, wings, tails, they evolved and evolved, giving rise to a whole new desendency. but that came with a price, they lost our original, primordial power. the power in our tentacles, the power to create waves.
with this power, we create sea storms, we create waves, we have power over the tide, we decided upon tsunami -in brief, we make what would be a desertly flat mass of land, a beautifully changing work of art, capturing at each momenet our collective moods -saddness, cheerfullness, angst. every breath of a tentacle of a medusa means a waves, somewhere, in some time. have you heard of the butterfly effect? that concept that the ignorant humans created to describe that, a small wink of a butterfly creates a thunderstorm somewhere else. of course they do not, but the smallest vibration of a medusa can generate a huge wave anywhere, that is the real butterfly effect, that is the medusa power.
once upon a time a tribe of proto capitalist humans understood the inner meaning of our seemingly placid essence. they wanted to trade,  gold for slaves for cotton for more gold, in an infinity speculation that fuels itself from endless greed. they wanted to kill us all, they started to go about organizing fishing hunts, and they tried to exterminate us. they wanted a flat sea, to conduct their mercantile exchanges. but they were unsuccesful, we were too many and we had powerful allies: our friends the sea horses, who lasso the waves to bring themselves forwards, pulling backword the wave. have you ever noticed? the crest of waves in the sea does not precede, but it follows the wave. it is our friends the sea horses riding that to move about and protect us, they are our knights, and rightfully so, the sea is the kingdom of medusas.

    I want to catch it. Like they do. Why can’t I catch it?! I try and it slips away. I try and I cannot hold it. I try and my pawn does not grasp like their hand.</p>

  <p> What can I do?</p>

  <p> How can I explain it to these humans, that I don’t want to make the bottle fall to the ground, I want to hold it and drink from it. I tried so hard. It is the same for every object. They are so skilled at using, bending, throwing, shaping, twisting, catching objects, and so much more. One time I saw them masturbating. If I knew how to do it, I could have explained them that I did not need to be operated to my testicles. That I could take care of myself, by myself, without big problems, please leave me this rather enjoyable aspect of life. But I cannot, could not, and have no more working testicles now.</p>

  <p> Yet I keep trying. I guess that they think I am playing. I am not, I am frustrated. The more I try to catch this pink bottle that is now on the ground, the more they laugh and think I am having a hell of a ride. I try again and again, and when I cannot do it anymore, I stop, suddenly, and jump away because I do not want them to see me cry.</p>

  <p> The other night I was trying to make a knot, using the thread they gave me, to “play”, as they think. I wanted, because I see them, every morning, knotting their shoes, and I think that is cool. But I never managed, all my attempts failed, and am still obliged to walk barefoot. I made a mess yesterday with the thread, I think I wasted a lot of thread, at a point I was thinking at hanging myself. But my claws cannot do even that.</p>

  <p> I am sorry that I made a mess. I am sorry that I spilled the glass full of water and fucked up the computer and her thesis inside. I am sorry that his pink bottle fell on the ground so many times. I am not able to let them know this. I feel so sorry. I can only hope they understood it by themselves.
